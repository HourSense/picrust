## Key Features

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with Claude (Anthropic) and Gemini
- **Tool System**: Built-in tools for file operations, bash commands, and more
- **MCP Integration**: Support for Model Context Protocol
- **Async-First**: Built on Tokio for high-performance async operations
- **Type-Safe**: Leverages Rust's type system for reliable agent behavior

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Add Shadow Agent SDK to your `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    shadow-agent-sdk = "0.1.0"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Agent">
    Initialize your first agent with the API key:
    ```rust
    use shadow_agent_sdk::Agent;

    let agent = Agent::new("your-api-key").await?;
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Tasks">
    Start executing tasks with your agent:
    ```rust
    let response = agent.execute("Help me analyze this code").await?;
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
